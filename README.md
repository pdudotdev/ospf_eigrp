## 🔍 Overview
The purpose of this project is to showcase the capabilities of **Claude AI** and **MCP**, combined with **Python** and **Scrapli**, in regards to network automation and troubleshooting.

By design, the project is **multi-vendor**, **multi-protocol**, **multi-area/multi-AS**, **OSI L3-focused**, in order to automate and troubleshoot various scenarios in a diverse and complex network.

This project assumes at least **CCNA**-level knowledge (**CCNP** preferred), as well as familiarity with **Linux** terminal commands, **Python** syntax, and multi-vendor **CLIs**.

I am **NOT** going to explain here how to build the topology | write the MCP server in Python | enhance the MCP server with new tools. I already did that from scratch in my beginner-friendly [**Udemy course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/mcp-server/?referralCode=D62613A8194D2D915B55). Feel free to join to get instructor support, regular updates, access to Discord etc.

🍀 **NOTE**: This is an evolving project, with new features being added periodically, so feel free to check back once in a while.
