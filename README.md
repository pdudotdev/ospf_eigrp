## 🔭 Overview
The purpose of this project is to showcase the capabilities of **Claude AI** and **MCP**, combined with **Python** and **Scrapli**, in regards to network automation and troubleshooting.

By design, the project is **multi-vendor**, **multi-protocol**, **multi-area/multi-AS**, **OSI L3-focused**, in order to automate and troubleshoot various scenarios in a diverse and complex network.

I am **NOT** going to explain here how to build the topology | write the MCP server in Python | enhance the MCP server with new tools. I already did that from scratch in my beginner-friendly [**Udemy course**](https://www.udemy.com/course/mcp-server/?referralCode=D62613A8194D2D915B55). Feel free to join to get instructor support, regular updates, access to Discord etc.

However, I am providing the **topology diagram**, the **startup config** of each router, as well as the actual **Containerlab YAML file** defining the network.

⚠️ **NOTE**: This project assumes at least **CCNA**-level knowledge (**CCNP** preferred), as well as familiarity with **Linux** terminal commands, **Python** syntax, and multi-vendor **CLIs**.

🍀 **NOTE**: This is an evolving project, with new features being added periodically, so feel free to check back once in a while.

## 🔄 Network Topology
- [x] Current network topology
  - *Subject to periodic upgrades*

![topology](/topology/TOPOLOGY.png)

- [x] Containerlab YAML file:
  - [Lab topology](lab.yml)

- [x] Router naming convention:
  - **RXY** where:
    - **R**: device type (router)
    - **X**: device number id
    - **Y**: vendor (A-Arista, C-Cisco, etc.)

- [x] Router configuration files:
  - R1A: [startup-config](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/blob/main/clab-mcp-lab/R1A/flash/)
  - R2A: [startup-config](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/blob/main/clab-mcp-lab/R2A/flash/)
  - R3C: [nvram_id](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/blob/main/clab-mcp-lab/R3C)
  - R4C: [nvram_id](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/tree/main/clab-mcp-lab/R4C)
  - R5C: [nvram_id](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/tree/main/clab-mcp-lab/R5C)
  - R6A: [startup-config](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/blob/main/clab-mcp-lab/R6A/flash/)
  - R7A: [startup-config](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/blob/main/clab-mcp-lab/R7A/flash/)
  - R8C: [nvram_id](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/tree/main/clab-mcp-lab/R8C)
  - R9C: [nvram_id](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/tree/main/clab-mcp-lab/R9C)
  - R10C: [nvram_id](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/tree/main/clab-mcp-lab/R10C)
  - R11C: [nvram_id](https://github.com/pdudotdev/netaimcp/tree/main/clab-mcp-lab/R11C)

⚠️ **NOTE**: To see the contents of the **nvram** files for Cisco routers, simply use **Notepad** in Windows or **cat** in Linux.

⚠️ **NOTE**: The config files above are considered the **default configuration** for this network, and their contents may change (or new files may be added) with each new **Release**, as the topology grows in complexity. Watch the release number and notes for this repository.

⚠️ **NOTE**: Since these config files above are considered the **default configuration** for this network, they are going to be your fallback config whenever you use `containerlab redeploy -t lab.yml`

## 🔥 Automation and Troubleshooting



## 🧪 Planned Upgrades
- [ ] Adding BGP
- [ ] Adding IS-IS
- [ ] Adding new vendors
