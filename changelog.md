## [v5.0.0]

> Cisco-only architecture with 2-tier transport (RESTCONF→SSH). 9 devices, all Cisco IOS/IOS-XE. Other vendors available as customizable modules per client need.

### 🌐 Topology
- 9-device Cisco IOS/IOS-XE topology (2 platforms: cisco_iol, cisco_c8000v)
- OSPF Area 0 + Area 1 stub, BGP dual-ISP (AS1010↔AS4040/AS5050), BGP AS2020 at X1C
- 5 SLA paths: OSPF cost-based primary/backup ABR selection (A1C/A2C via C1C/C2C)
- Full redundancy across the Access, Collapsed Core, Edge-to-ISP layers

### 🔌 Transports
- **2-tier for c8000v**: RESTCONF (primary, httpx/JSON) → SSH (fallback, Scrapli/CLI)
- **SSH-only for IOL**: A1C, A2C, IAN, IBN
- `ActionChain` class in `platform_map.py` for ordered transport fallback
- Config push: all devices use SSH CLI

### 🏗️ Architecture
- Clear separation between **Interactive** and **Service** modes
- `PLATFORM_MAP` with 2 distinct sections: `ios`, `ios_restconf`
- `transport/restconf.py` — httpx AsyncClient for RESTCONF reads; 
- RESTCONF now has dedicated BGP/OSPF trim functions to reduce token cost
- Transport dispatcher with ActionChain fallback iteration + `_transport_used` tag

### 🔧 Fixes
- Deferred-event scanner deduplicates by `(device, msg)` — SLA oscillation (Down→Up→Down) no longer triggers false deferred sessions
- Jira client: module-level globals replaced with `_config()` helper that reads env vars at call time (fixes stale-config under systemd)
- `oncall-watcher.service`: EnvironmentFile commented out — systemd doesn't strip inline comments from `.env`, corrupting values that python-dotenv handles correctly

### 📡 Transport Visibility
- Result dict includes `_command` field (actual CLI command or RESTCONF URL) right after `device` for inline visibility in Claude Code
- Debug logging added to SSH and RESTCONF executors

### 🧪 Testing
- 416 unit + watcher-events tests (up from 244)
- 16 unit test files, covering: transport dispatch, RESTCONF/SSH executors, config push, tool layer, Jira tools
- New integration tests: full MCP tool coverage, transport layer, platform coverage
- New test: deferred excludes trigger device's repeated SLA oscillation events

## [v4.5.0]

> On-Call-first architecture. Standalone mode retired as an official mode. Tool set simplified.

### 🏗 Architecture
- Retired Standalone Mode as an official workflow — On-Call is now the primary mode; ad-hoc console troubleshooting remains supported via the 6 Core Principles
- Removed `snapshot_state` tool and all snapshot infrastructure (feature was write-only — no programmatic reader existed)
- Added `on_call: bool` parameter to `push_config` — bypasses the maintenance window when `True` (On-Call fixes apply at any hour)
- Risk assessment (`assess_risk`) now surfaced before user approval: agent calls it in On-Call step 4 and includes risk level in the findings table

### 🧪 Testing
- 281 tests: removed 6 snapshot input validation tests, added 3 on_call model/bypass tests
- Manual E2E: retired ST-00x Standalone test suite; OC-001, MW-001, and WB-001–004 remain
- 15 MCP tools registered (snapshot_state removed)

## [v4.0.0]

> Major **quality, reliability, and security** release.
> No new protocols or vendors — hardened foundation for v4.5.

### 🔐 Security & Safety
- Enforced maintenance windows in `push_config` (blocked outside policy)
- Restricted `run_show` to read-only commands (no config bypass)
- RouterOS REST validation (forbidden paths blocked, POST rejected)
- Syslog prompt injection mitigation (sanitize + delimiter)
- Expanded forbidden command set (5 → 14 patterns)
- Configurable TLS/SSL per transport:
  - `VERIFY_TLS`
  - `ROUTEROS_USE_HTTPS`
  - `SSH_STRICT_HOST_KEY`

### 🏗 Architecture
- Decomposed monolithic `MCPServer.py` (798 lines) into:
  - `tools/`
  - `transport/`
  - `core/`
  - `input_models/`
- Implemented bounded LRU cache (256 entries, TTL-based eviction)
- Added connection pooling for eAPI and REST transports
- Enforced HTTP timeouts on all device and Jira connections
- Added structured JSON logging with configurable levels

### 🧠 Troubleshooting Methodology
- Introduced **6 Core Troubleshooting Principles** (mandatory, ordered) — see `CLAUDE.example.md`
- Rewrote Standalone Mode into 10 deterministic steps with decision gates
- Added protocol skill prerequisite gates (interfaces + neighbors verified before deep investigation)
- Implemented role-aware risk assessment using `INTENT.json` and SLA paths

### 🚨 On-Call & Operational
- SLA recovery (Up) event detection and logging
- Added service mode (`--service` flag, renamed from `-d`/`--daemon`) with tmux session support and `wall` notification
- Added systemd service file (`oncall/oncall-watcher.service`) for production deployment
- ~~Added pre-change snapshot support in `push_config`~~ *(removed in v4.5 — feature was write-only)*
- Generated rollback advisory for all config changes

### 🧪 Testing
- 230 unit tests across 9 test files (up from 3 in v3.0) *(229 in v4.5 after snapshot tests removed)*
- 4 integration test files with `NO_LAB` skip guards
- 12 manual E2E scenarios:
  - 7 standalone
  - 1 on-call
  - 1 maintenance window
  - 3 watcher
- Enforced Pydantic `Literal` validation on all query parameters
